<h1> CST-AWSCloudParameters Project </h1> 

A web application that retrieves and filters parameters in Cell Signaling Technology's AWS account. 

<h2> Summary </h2> 

This project was a part of my internship for Cell Singaling Technologies (CST). At CST, I studied under CST's Director of Software Engineering. I first learned how CST leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to manage and build their digital infrastructure. I earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification and gained hands-on experience with foundational AWS services such as EC2, S3, VPCs, Systems Manager, IAM, Lambda, and more. The purpose of this project is to retrieve and filter parameters stored in Parameter Store in AWS Systems Managager. My code first securely authenticates an AWS account using an AWS access key and secret key. Then, the program sets the AWS region and makes a request to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

<h2> Softwares and Technologies </h2> 

This project is coded in Java, and uses Maven to build the code. Additionally, the program utilizes the Spring Framework (Spring Boot). These two technologies are essential to allowing the application to run. Maven converts the API specifications written in OpenAPU to source code. Spring Boot helps manage the dependencies in the application. In order to communicate with AWS, the program uses the AWS SDK for Java.
